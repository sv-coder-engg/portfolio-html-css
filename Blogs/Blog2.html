        <h2>Call to Adventure</h2>
        <p>
            A young naïve boy living a simple life but then something unorthodox happens to him. This presents the call
            for an adventure, and he sees this call. He’s both interested and afraid and stuck in his mundane system, so
            he refuses the call.
            <br><br>
            But then the call presents to himself again, but he has no other option but to face the call of this
            adventure and accept that call. This is the point where his <strong>Journey begins.</strong> 

        </p>

        <h2>The Challenges and Temptations</h2>
        <p>
            He sees this goal or holy grail then goes on to achieve it but then at first level he reaches a threshold
            guardian. He might win or lose against him. If he wins, he will burst through all other guardians to reach
            the belly of the beast. He has to face his greatest demons in order to beat the final boss. He gets into a
            phase where his own fear and insecurities are holding him back. Then he realises that he is not here to
            defeat all these enemies but is on a journey to discover himself and overcome his fears.

            <br><br>
            Then after this realisation, finally he prevails. The holy grail he is after is just a few steps ahead, and
            now he realises that in this process he has become wise and now the grail for him has taken on a new
            meaning.
        </p>

        <h2>The Return </h2>
        <p>
            And then, he used this newfound wisdom and shares his grail with his tribe, and now a new journey begins of
            sharing his knowledge with others.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
            <em>
                NOTE – Defeat may be because either the cause is not deep enough or because of our own inner demons
