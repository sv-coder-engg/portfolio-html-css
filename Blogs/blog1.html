            We often overestimate the importance of  that one defining moments that might occur in our life and underestimate the value of making small improvement on a daily basis. We often think that to get success we need to do massive action and put so much pressure on ourselves to improve in such a drastic manner. Meaning improving just by 1% isn't even noticeable but in long run in a more meaning to get the desired results.
            <br>
            <br>
            A small change in our habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degree.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Therefore some important things to note :</strong></h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All big things come from small beginnings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forget the goals and Focus on the system instead. Fix the inputs and the output fix themselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We set goals in order to achieve them and win the game. But the purpose of building a system or habit is to continue playing the game. If we think in a long term perspective, it is not about a single accomplishment but a process of continuous improvement and ultimately, it is our commitment to the process that will determine our progress.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2><strong>Types of Habits </strong> <small>and which to choose</small> </h2>

        <p>
            Habits can be categorized into two types one is outcome based habits whose focus is on what we want to achieve and other is identity based habits which focuses on who we want to become.
            <br><br>
            Often itâ€™s been seen that the more pride we have in our particular aspect of identity, the more motivated we become in to maintain the habits associated with it. Therefore we first need to identify the type of person we want to be become and then slowly in the form of habits work toward continuously
